# 📊 YFinance to Excel

In a _freedy_ world, access to data shouldn’t come with a price tag.  
This tool is for everyone who just wants their stock prices — **no paywalls, no subscriptions, no Python degree required.**

Yahoo Finance used to let you download data for free. Now?  
**$500/year** for an export button 😩

Luckily, this app gives that power back — for free.
